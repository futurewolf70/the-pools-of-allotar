The Pools of Allotar is a level 3-4 adventure designed for Shadowdark RPG, but also broadly compatible with other OSR/NSR systems. It is a small dungeon with 10 rooms, good for 2.5-3 hours of play.

For many years the kind witch Allotar invited bathers to visit her cavern pools in exchange for food and small gifts. The pools themselves are said to be restorative and even to cure baldness. This is due to the nearby deposits of a rare and mystical mineral called harrensmedel that Allotar frequently dissolved in the pool. Lately, however, Allotar has been demanding more extravagant gifts, and many visitors have not returned or even refused to leave. The party may try to rescue the lost bathers, resolve the situation with Allotar or maybe just get a nice bath themselves.
